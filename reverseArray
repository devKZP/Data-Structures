/*
stdin: a, an array of elements
stdout: a new array with elements of a in reverse order
Explanation:
An array is indexed starting at 0. 
To reverse the array, we start from the last valid index (a.length - 1) and iterate backward, 
appending each element to a new array. The loop decrements until the first element is added, 
producing a reversed array.

function reverseArray(a) {
   var newArr = [];
   for(var i=a.length; i != -1; i--){
    newArr.push(a[i]);
   }
   return newArr;
}
